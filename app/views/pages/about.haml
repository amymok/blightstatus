      %h2 What does it do?
      %p BlightStatus makes it simple for residents to find out what’s going on with blighted properties in their community – no long waits on the telephone or visits to City Hall required. 
      %p A great example of government transparency at work, BlightStatus pulls up-to-date property information directly from the City’s official records, providing a single, comprehensive and authoritiative view to the public for the very first time.       

      .left{:style => "padding-top: 10px;"}
        %h4{:style => " margin-bottom: 5px"} The latest status, at a glance

        %p Check out a property’s status bar to instantly see where that property stands in the blight process – and what’s coming next. Want to know more? Scroll down  to the detailed case history for a step-by-step description of what’s happened so far, and when.

      %h2 Why did we make it?
      %p In New Orleans, countless organizations are working around the clock to improve local communities and reduce blight throughout the city -- from community groups and non-profits to City Hall and the local Redevelopment Authority (NORA). 

      %p However, each of these organizations collect and manage data about blighted properties in entirely different ways, which results in duplicated efforts, inconsistent information, and precious energy wasted.

      %p We’ve partnered with New Orleans City Hall and NORA to create this site to provide accurate and up-to-date information about the City’s efforts to reduce blight that everybody can use. We hope that this simple and publicly-accessible resource will make the work of these great organizations just a little bit easier.
